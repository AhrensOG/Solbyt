            "answer": "Depending on the type of analysis, we may require read-only access to source code, development or staging environments, and technical documentation. For performance analysis, we access logs, metrics, and system configurations. We always work under strict confidentiality agreements and, when necessary, use anonymized data. We never access sensitive production data without explicit supervision."

          {
            "question": "Will the analysis affect the normal operation of the system?",
            "answer": "No. Our approach is non-intrusive and mainly performed on development, staging, and historical data environments. If production observation is needed, we use passive tools that do not interfere with performance. Risky tests are planned with your team and executed during low-activity periods."

We also add technical annexes with metrics and evidence, plus a presentation session to address your teamâ€™s questions."

            "question": "Can you help implement the recommended improvements?",

It is also advisable before migrations, updates, or persistent problems. We offer recurring analysis plans for continuous monitoring."
